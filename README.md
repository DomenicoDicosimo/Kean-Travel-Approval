# Kean-Travel-Approval

The purpose of this project is to streamline and improve the existing travel
approval workflow for faculty and students attending conferences and events. The current
process involves significant paperwork, multiple signatures, and delays in approvals, leading to
inefficiencies and increased costs. By implementing an online platform and enhancing the
workflow, we aim to reduce administrative burdens, improve communication, and provide a
more user-friendly experience for all stakeholders involved.
